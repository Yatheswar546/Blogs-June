We know it’s cliché, but it’s overused for a reason: because it’s true!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’ve ever looked up ways to eat better, you’ve probably heard the terms “insulin sensitivity” and “insulin resistance.” You might even have come across an insulin resistance diet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But what exactly do these terms mean, and why is it important to maintain a healthy insulin response?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s explore the science of insulin sensitivity and resistance, discuss the key role that diet plays in managing these conditions, and provide you with seven foods for insulin resistance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Insulin Sensitivity vs. Insulin Resistance</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p>First, let’s start with the basics. Insulin is a hormone produced by the body that helps regulate blood sugar levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If blood sugar levels are not properly regulated, you may experience health issues such as fatigue, dizziness, or more serious complications like diabetes or cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Insulin Sensitivity</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Insulin sensitivity refers to how effectively the body’s cells respond to insulin. When you have high insulin sensitivity, your body needs less insulin to lower blood sugar levels.</p><p>This is an ideal situation, as it means your body can efficiently process the glucose in your blood and use it for energy or store it for later use.</p><p>High insulin sensitivity is generally associated with better health outcomes, including a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and obesity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Factors that can improve insulin sensitivity include the following:</strong></p><p>Regular exercise<br>Maintaining a healthy weight<br>Consuming a well-balanced<br>Getting enough sleep<br>Insulin Resistance<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Insulin resistance, on the other hand, is a condition where the body’s cells become less responsive to insulin. This means that more insulin is required to maintain normal blood sugar levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When insulin resistance develops, the pancreas produces more insulin to compensate, but over time, it may not be able to keep up with the increased demand. This can lead to elevated blood sugar levels and eventually type 2 diabetes, if not addressed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Factors that contribute to insulin resistance include the following:</strong></p><p>Sedentary lifestyle<br>Excess body weight (particularly around the abdomen)<br>Poor diet<br>Chronic stress<br>Insufficient sleep<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Foods That Improve Insulin Sensitivity</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p>The food you eat has a significant impact on your body’s ability to regulate insulin. Eating a diet high in processed foods, refined carbohydrates, and sugars can contribute to insulin resistance.</p><p>On the other hand, a diet rich in whole foods, healthy fats, and high-quality proteins can help improve insulin sensitivity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are our top seven foods that improve insulin sensitivity and fight insulin resistance.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Whole Grains</strong><br>Whole grains are beneficial for insulin sensitivity and combating insulin resistance due to their high fiber content, low glycemic index, nutrient composition, and contribution to weight management.</p><p>Incorporating whole grains into your diet can help promote better blood sugar control, support healthy insulin function, and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. [1]</p><p>Examples of whole grains include quinoa, brown rice, whole wheat, barley, and oats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Leafy Greens</strong><br>Leafy greens, such as spinach, kale, and collard greens, are low in calories but they are also packed with fiber, micronutrients, antioxidants, and phytochemicals.</p><p>Including them in your diet can help with weight management, which is essential for maintaining insulin sensitivity and reducing the risk of insulin resistance.[2]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Fatty Fish</strong><br>Fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, and herring, can help improve insulin sensitivity due to their high content of omega-3 fatty acids and other essential nutrients.</p><p>Fatty fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid).</p><p>These essential fatty acids have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help counteract chronic inflammation that impairs insulin function and contributes to insulin resistance.&nbsp;</p>', 0x66633939353037316266626463313065396335663335666466333230633662662e6a7067, 'Health & Fitness', 'YatheswaR', '303412271d26c76e58de17b14160c1dd', '2023-06-22 10:24:16.677412'),
(2, '20 Biggest Movie Stars of the 1940s', '<p>The Golden Age of Hollywood, in all its glamour and panache, was quite a significant period in the history of cinema. It began in 1927 with the introduction of sound films, and started waning in the late 1960s with the demise of the controlling studio system. Amateur performers flocked from all corners of the world to become the next Jean Harlow, Greta Garbo, Clark Gable, or Fred Astaire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thousands of pictures were produced in the 1940s, especially in the war, film noir, neo-realism, romantic comedy, and elaborate musical genres. Many of them were considered innovative and are still revisited to this day: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Bicycle Thief, The Philadelphia Story, The Maltese Falcon, Gaslight, It’s a Wonderful Life, Notorious, and Gilda are all fine examples. None of these films would have been possible without the talent and charisma of their leads, though; these icons were admired back then and are still appreciated by cinephiles in this day and age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is a non-exhaustive look back at 20 of the most prominent film actors of that decade, in no particular order, from James Cagney, to Katharine Hepburn, to James Stewart.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>James Cagney<br><br>James Francis Cagney Jr. was an actor, dancer, and film director who was known for his roles as the archetypal tough guy and for having an on-and-off collaboration with Warner Bros. He made 12 films in the 1940s, the most famous of which are City for Conquest, The Fighting 69th, The Strawberry Blonde, Johnny Come Lately, and Yankee Doodle Dandy, which earned him an Academy Award.</p><p>He died of a heart attack in 1986 at the age of 86.</p>', 0x35643738373862356132373261386661316439353364343639623636626331652e6a7067, 'Movies', 'YatheswaR', '511cee9978adf759cf0a32292bc452a2', '2023-06-22 10:24:48.836536'),
(3, 'Connecting to Care', '<p>Can you think of a place in nature that you know really well?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Close your eyes for a moment and see what comes up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can you visualise the place in exquisite detail? The sounds, the colours, the smells, the subtleties that only you know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do memories surface? Perhaps you have known this place for a long time. Maybe you spent golden moments from your childhood here? There might be happy memories tinged with sadness or regret?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How does it feel when you bring this place to mind now?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please don’t rush. Take a moment to connect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now another question.</p><p>How would you feel if this same place was under imminent threat? Imagine someone is destroying it right now. What do you feel? Anger? Sadness? Shock? Resignation? Nothing at all?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can you imagine that you might actually do something immediate and tangible to help protect this place?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Be honest with yourself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you really have a deep connection with this place, it is likely that you might feel moved to do something. That’s obvious, right? We naturally and instinctively act to protect that which we care very deeply about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But what if that deep connection with a place is absent? How would that affect your response? It’s a beautiful place but it’s not your place. Are you still likely to do something about it? Is it your responsibility?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let me paint two scenarios for you…</p><p>You are walking through town at night and you see your best friend looking dishevelled, sleeping rough on the street. You haven’t seen him for six months. There is probably an initial shock: “Oh my God, what happened?!!” You instinctively reach out for him. Before you know it your arm is on his shoulder: “Come home with me. Let me take care of you”.</p><p>Now another night. This time you see a random stranger looking dishevelled, sleeping rough on the street. Be honest. What do you do? Is it someone else’s problem? If your heart is big enough you might give him some money or buy him a sandwich but is he coming home to sleep on your couch? Perhaps you rationalise your inaction by reminding yourself that you donate to the local homeless charity. You might remind yourself to vote for a politician who appears committed to doing something. But most of the time most of us don’t do anything at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why the difference? It’s obvious isn’t it… in the first scenario you don’t even think. You have a deep emotional connection with your best friend and you have to act. In the second scenario you might feel sad and you might recognise the tragedy of the situation but there is no emotional connection between the two of you, so more often than not you don’t act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Steinbeck put it very well when he wrote (at a time when there was famine in China): “It means very little to know that a million Chinese are starving unless you know one Chinese who is starving.” There needs to be an emotional connection for the thing to have any meaning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is the very same when it comes to the environmental crisis. There is a groundswell of support at the moment for taking steps to avert climate change. The reality that there is a problem seems to have finally dawned on a lot of people. But still most people don’t really “do” anything significant do they? I’m not being self-righteous or judgemental here. I know that I’m guilty of it myself. Why are we all so passive? Why do we wait for someone else to do something?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are a number of reasons and it’s not simple (and I certainly don’t have the answer). I have thought about it a lot though and I have some ideas:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sheer scale of the problem is so frightening, most of us don’t feel capable of doing anything meaningful. The tree is about to fall down and I am just a tiny ant!<br>Society as currently constructed is designed to make us passive and docile. We lead incredibly busy lives… commute, work, eat, exercise, shop, look after the kids, more work, Netflix, bed. Most of us just sleepwalk through life on automatic pilot waiting for the next brief window of pleasure. One day blending into the next. We have hardly any time to reflect, let alone act.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Many in society feel socially isolated. The sense of community has broken down. Loneliness is an epidemic at the moment. If you feel like you are on your own, you are far less likely to summon up the courage to do something. The Titanic is sinking and you are just one person with a bucket. Everyone else on the boat is a stranger to you.

ChatGPT uses the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), while Bard uses the Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMBDA). Also, ChatGPT is developed by OpenAI, while Bard was built by Google.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of capabilities, both do very similar things. Programmers can use ChatGPT for:<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Suggestions</strong>: Both models can suggest the correct syntax and parameters for functions and other code constructs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Completion</strong>: It can complete code that you have started writing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Debugging</strong>: It can help you identify errors and problems in your code.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation</strong>: It can explain the code that it generates, or code you input.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Both models were trained on a massive dataset, including Common Crawl, Wikipedia, books, articles, documents, and content scraped from the internet. However, Bard is a little different in that it was trained on conversations and dialogues from the web, while ChatGPT was trained mostly on scraped general content.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Both products are still under development, Bard a bit more so than ChatGPT. But to really show how these differences actually matter in a practical sense, here’s how they work when tested against each other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Testing ChatGPT and Bard against each other</strong><br>We chose seven categories to test the chatbots against each other, based on what we felt were the most relevant: code generation, problem solving, refactoring code, debugging assistance, third-party plugins/UI extension, ease of use, and cost.

For this, we fed in the following prompt: \\\"Write a function in python that returns a list of 100 prime numbers.\\\"</p><p>When we run the same prompt by ChatGPT, this code defines a function generate_primes(n) that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of all prime numbers up to n. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate the primes.<br>Both of these produced a functional result. ChatGPT\\\'s example is better in this case, since it\\\'s cleaner and has much less code. Also, it interpreted our vague prompt correctly. However, this is only one use-case: it\\\'s known that chatbots will vary a lot in their response depending on the language they are using (With less common or documented languages having more errors) or the complexity of the query.

If you have watched his past films you will get to know what level of action this actor is capable of. Reports reveal that Rama Rao had to go through an 18-month rigorous training program to step into the character of Bheem, who has been portrayed as an immense physical specimen in RRR.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ram Charan, the son of the legendary actor Chiranjeevi, is another explosive action hero in the South Indian film industry. He sports a tremendous muscular physique and his physique has amplified the character of Alluri Sitarama Raju. If you have watched his hit-action thriller “Yevadu”, you would agree that he is one of those superstars whom even the Bollywood industry would crave for!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A Cinematic Masterpiece</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RRR is a true magnum opus by Rajamouli.</strong> If you happen to watch this movie the first thing that will astound you is its masterpiece cinematography. RRR is not just an action film but I must say it is a cinematic work of art! The locations and the VFX-generated landscapes were a visual feast! The filming of RRR was done extensively in India with a few scenes being shot in Bulgaria and Ukraine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The 1920s era Indian village landscapes, the dense forests, the roaring bright blue seas, the British palatial buildings, and horse carriages gave an enchanting retro essence to the movie. Komaram Bheem’s tiger especially amazed me. What a remarkable CGI animal! It looked much more like the prehistoric Ngandong tiger rather than a Bengal tiger. The sad part is that in Rajamouli’s movies the cinematography comprises visual effects only. So, most of the filming takes place in green room sets and the beautiful sceneries and backgrounds you see are just CGI. They are not real! I must credit cinematographer K. K. Senthil Kumar and editor A. Sreekar Prasad for this cinematic masterpiece.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A Smashing Screenplay</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The screenplay of RRR by Rajamouli involved highly thrilling instances along with mind-boggling action stunts! You probably wouldn’t have ever come across an action screenplay like this before. High-intensity one-on-one fights, human-animal encounters, people and vehicles being thrown around like paper balls, gun action, ear-rumbling explosions, and traditional bow-arrow and spear warfare; all make RRR’s screenplay a thing to remember. In short, this is an all-in-one action screenplay!</p><p>Just watch Rama Rao’s motorcycle flip and you will get an idea of the screenplay of RRR. He flips the motorcycle with his leg and catches it by its front tire in the air. And even if you do not watch the entire movie, just don’t forget to watch the tiger scene where Bheem’s colossal tiger pounces on the British forces and goes one-on-one with Ram!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A Great Supporting Cast</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The supporting cast of RRR involved Ray Stevenson, Alia Bhatt, Alison Doody, Olivia Morris, and Ajay Devgan. Ray Stevenson with his villainous expressions in the character of Scott Buxton made the screenplay direly intriguing. He had a comical essence in his action scenes as well. In one scene he was on a chase in his open hood vintage car and a tree fell on the car’s boot. The front portion of the car jerked upwards, hurtling him and his rifle in a vertical position. At that position, he grabbed the rifle, took an aim, and shot his target. Despite the serious action, this scene looked somewhat comical to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ajay Devgan had a short role in RRR as Ram’s revolutionary father. However, his short role created a big impact from the movie’s point of view. Alia Bhatt didn’t have much screen time in RRR. Her role in the film spanned less than 10 minutes. However, she carried out her character of Ram’s fiancée Sita quite diligently. Alison Doody and Oliva Morris too had very short roles in the movie which they carried out well.

(10, 'Scrum v/s SAFe', '<p>Agile project management has made waves through software development circles. Much of Agile’s appeal lies in its flexibility. Thanks to its range of strategies, you can pick an Agile framework suited to your unique needs or strengths. With this in mind, many organizations choose between the Scrum vs. SAFe approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While both frameworks are popular, they can reshape your organization in different ways. So, when deciding between Scrum vs. SAFe, you have to consider your resources and goals. To help you pick the best framework, we’ll describe both approaches, their similarities and differences, and the kind of teams they’re best suited for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is Scrum?</strong></p><p><br>Scrum is an Agile framework in which small, self-organized teams deliver high-quality software quickly. Scrum development values simplicity, creating adaptable teams that make deliveries based on stakeholder input. To make this work, Scrum devs break large projects into small steps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By building cross-functional teams, Scrum empowers devs to address multiple issues and project types. Its small team structure also maintains productivity and cost-effectiveness as requirements change. Smaller teams also ensure every dev knows who to talk to about specific issues. This streamlined setup fosters collaboration and lets team members review their work more thoroughly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Scrum development relies on three key roles:</strong></p><p>Product Owners align a Scrum team’s goals with customer and stakeholder expectations. They can also provide feedback or insight on product requirements.&nbsp;<br>Scrum Masters oversee a Scrum team and Scrum processes. They remove dev obstacles, keeping team members productive and on task.<br>Scrum teams work with the above two roles to complete the goals outlined in each sprint planning phase. They’re the boots-on-the-ground employees who build a product.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros and cons of Scrum</strong><br>To better understand Scrum, here are its main advantages and drawbacks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong><br>Optimized dev processes</p><p>Emphasis on the end user’s wants</p><p>Fast delivery times</p><p>Easy coordination within small teams</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong><br>Difficult to scale to larger projects</p><p>Requires teamwide training</p><p>Dev cycles may not always align with project deadlines</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who is Scrum best for?</strong><br>Scrum complements small organizations and independent teams. In particular, you should use Scrum if your devs run up against:</p><p>Frequent input from stakeholders and customers</p><p>Changing deliverables teams must adapt to</p><p>Short turnaround times before delivering high-quality products</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is SAFe?</strong><br>The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) helps organizations set objectives and meet customer demands. Whereas Scrum relies on narrow focus and small teams, SAFe is more comprehensive. It coordinates multiple groups and leaders to deliver products too large or complex for Scrum.</p><p>SAFe exchanges Scrum’s flexibility for a more rigid structure. While it offers continuous development, SAFe sets objectives that vary by team. However, these different groups complement one another and work toward the same end goals. To manage this organization, SAFe incorporates three core tenets:<br>Lean Product Development reduces waste and optimizes processes. This cost-effective approach maintains productivity during continuous development.&nbsp;<br>Agile Software Development involves incremental changes made on the fly. This iterative approach accounts for feedback and new demands. While less flexible than Scrum, SAFe still makes room for fast adaptations in development.<br>System Thinking is a dev approach that builds solutions holistically. When designing a product, teams would incorporate all aspects of the system. This approach highlights how all parts of a system relate and fit into larger systems.</p><p><br><strong>Pros and cons of SAFe</strong><br>Like Scrum, SAFe’s pros and cons lend themselves to some teams more than others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>Agility and a competitive edge for businesses</p><p>Increased cooperation between teams</p><p>Added barriers to prevent product issues</p><p>Improved operations at an enterprise level</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>Poor fit for small businesses and startups</p><p>Teams must learn shared Agile language</p><p>Relies on a more rigid, top-down framework</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who is SAFe best for?</strong><br>SAFe works best for organizations that practice Agile at an enterprise scale.

(13, 'nature is a teacher', '<p>A number of years ago I went on holiday to a beautiful part of Portugal. We stayed in a converted farmhouse in the middle of a national park. The farmhouse was in a valley. We arrived in the evening when the birds were just starting to roost. It was still warm and the air smelled sweet with pollen. You could hear the hum of crickets. A small river flowed through that valley. We opened a rickety gate and crossed a small wooden bridge. As we walked along the narrow path that led to our house I had a clear vision of what my morning routine would be like for the next fourteen days. I had been working hard for the last few months and I felt tired. I wanted this holiday to be a mini retreat. I would wake up early each day when it was still quite cool and I would meditate for a while. I imagined myself sitting in a peaceful spot, my mind calm, my body relaxed… listening to the river flowing, hearing the birds and wildlife starting to stir, feeling the first rays of the early morning sun hit my face as it rose over the top of the hill. Present. Even as I write this now, it sounds like paradise to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I work up early the next morning and it was just as I imagined it would be. There is nothing like the stillness of the early morning. There was a gentle, peaceful feeling that enveloped me. It didn’t come from me but seemed to come from the earth and the river and the mountains. Everything was clearer than usual. The mind wasn’t racing here and there the way it normally does. I had never been to this place before but it felt welcoming and familiar. I found a spot to sit quietly. I could hear the faint hum of insects. The air was very still and there was only an occasional gentle breeze. A fly landed on my face. After a moment or two I carefully lifted my hand and gently ushered him away. Then another fly landed on my face. And another. And another. The feeling I had experienced a few moments ago was gone. I endured thirty minutes or so of mild torture that first morning before I admitted defeat and retreated to the farmhouse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the ensuing days I experimented with different approaches. I went to a different spot to try and escape the flies. I went at different times of the day. I had been practicing meditation for many years already and I had dealt with all kinds of distractions and obstacles in the past. I was sure that this would be no different. I had heard lots of stories and parables about similar experiences where the “lesson” is: “Your resistance to things not being the way you want them to be is the real source of your suffering. Drop your resistance. Drop your attachment to things being a certain way”. Words. I had repeated these same words to others many times. The words made sense to me and I believed them. I said these words to myself now. I tried to feel compassion for each fly that landed on me. I tried to change my perspective. I tried to simply experience the movements of each fly as pure sensation on my skin. I reminded myself that flies are an important part of the ecosystem and tried to appreciate each fly. I was lying to myself. Things weren’t going the way I wanted them to. I really hated those flies. I just felt irritated and tense. I was in a constant state of vigilance…waiting for the next fly to land on my skin, knowing that I would have to “mindfully” endure its presence for as long as possible until finally, when I could take no more, I would choose to “mindfully” flick it away… knowing also that in a few moments it would inevitably return. I thought about abandoning my plan to practice outside in nature and moving inside to the farmhouse. I’m stubborn though and I endured several more mornings of mental torture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that I couldn’t drop my resistance to things being a certain way was making things worse. I was also annoyed with myself now. The more I “tried” to be patient and accepting about the flies, the worse I felt. All this effort was adding unnecessary layers of suffering to my experience. More words. I already knew this. I had heard this advice many times in the past: “Stop making effort. When you practice just allow everything to be exactly as it is.”</p><p>On this morning, I was sitting in a sheltered spot near the river under an old Holm Oak. If you observed me from a distance you might think that I was in heaven. I didn’t feel like I was in heaven as a solitary fly methodically explored the back of my hand and several more buzzed dangerously close to my face. A question came to mind: in this moment what would actually happen if I did nothing and allowed EVERYTHING to be exactly as it is? I began conducting my experiment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First things first – what was my actual experience in this moment?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was tired. Fine, allow that to be as it is. Don’t resist it or ignore it or try to change it. You’re tired. Don’t even intentionally explore the experience of being tired.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I noticed some tension in my shoulders and face. Fine, allow there to be tension in your shoulders. That’s the way it is right now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I noticed an urge to relax my shoulders. Fine, allow that urge to just be there. Don’t follow the urge, don’t resist the urge, just acknowledge it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I noticed a recurring thought – “when will the next bloody fly land on my face!” Fine, allow that thought to be there. Don’t cling to the thought, don’t push it away, don’t try to&nbsp;</p><p>change it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I noticed the tension in my shoulders softened a little bit as if by itself. Fine, I just noticed that feeling of relaxation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I noticed more thoughts – “ok Barry, you might feel more relaxed now but just wait until the next fly lands on your face, you’ll be back to square one!” Same approach. Allow the&nbsp;</p><p>thoughts to just be there. Let them come and let them go. Don’t interfere. Don’t analyse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I noticed the fly which had been meandering on my hand suddenly take flight and a moment later land on my cheek. This was it! What would happen if I just allowed that fly to be there on my face?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I noticed all kinds of things. I noticed a feeling excitement, as if I was a scientist reaching the pivotal moment of his experiment. Fine, allow that feeling of excitement to be there.&nbsp;</p><p>The initial tiredness I felt at the start was gone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I noticed very intense, unpleasant sensations on my face as the fly moved around. Fine, allow those sensations to be there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I noticed thoughts telling me how I “should” react to the fly with imperturbable equanimity. Fine, more thoughts. Don’t try to stop them. Let them be there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I noticed other thoughts telling me to abandon this stupid experiment and try to whack the fly… even if that meant slapping myself in the face! Fine, allow those thoughts to be there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As I followed this unfolding series of experiences an interesting thing happened. The fly was still on my face but because the focus of my practice was simply exploring what would happen if I allowed it and everything else to be there exactly as it was, there was a natural softening. Whatever happened was fine. If I felt irritation about the fly…fine. If I felt acceptance about the fly…fine. There was no longer any effort, just awareness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I started to notice other things which I had not been aware of before. I could hear the steady sound of the river flowing. I could feel the subtle change in temperature on my skin as the wind increased in intensity and then stopped. I was aware of the weight of my body and the contact between my body and the earth. The fly was no longer the focus of my attention. Whatever I was aware of, the approach was the same. Let it be exactly as it is. There was a naturally occurring state of peace and deep stillness. If I had tried I could never have experienced this. It didn’t last. It never does. As always some random thought about the past or the future came along and carried me away from the present moment. I was lost in a daydream for a while. No longer aware of my experience.</p>', 0x36646637353733633837613866343136613036323539393639653339653162392e6a7067, 'Nature', 'Suhaas', '00696038f9a4c6c06a2fb64610acc245', '2023-06-22 10:39:39.837133');

Security and compliance requirements</strong><br>Whether it’s HIPAA, PCI DSS, NIST, FedRAMP, or something else, security and compliance isn’t anything new for public sector organizations. No matter how familiar you are with various compliance frameworks, shifting to the cloud means navigating new regulations while ensuring security standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Lack of cloud workers</strong><br>Historically, the public sector has struggled to compete with the private sector for tech talent. And that hasn’t changed.</p><p>Even as more tech talent enters the market (due to layoffs in the tech industry), government agencies struggle to recruit and retain cloud engineers. Why? Complex hiring processes, less competitive benefits, and lack of flexibility often top the list.</p><p>But legacy technology systems also present a substantial barrier. Many cloud workers want to stay on the cutting edge and lack the skills or desire to work with the legacy systems that pervade public sector organizations.</p><p><br><strong>3. Acquiring cloud services that meet public sector contract requirements</strong><br>Cloud computing services use a pay-as-you-go pricing model. This lets agencies scale their cloud services up or down to meet their current needs.</p><p>Public sector organizations can use indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts to invest in metered services like cloud computing. However, these contracts are often time-consuming and costly to set up.</p><p>Even if you’re able to navigate IDIQ contracts, your agency may face scrutiny about which cloud service providers you offer those contracts to.</p><p><br><strong>4. Legacy infrastructure spending</strong><br>Public sector organizations, including the federal government, continue to prioritize legacy, on-premises systems despite the push to the cloud.</p><p>In fact, even though 54% of public sector CIOs said they’d increase cloud spend at the beginning of 2022, only 35% said they’d decrease spending on legacy infrastructure and data center technologies.

(16, 'Intermediate Fasting', '<p><strong>What is Intermittent Fasting?</strong><br>Intermittent fasting is all the rage right now. But what is intermittent fasting? And more importantly, what are the benefits of this type of eating schedule? In this blog post, we’ll discuss intermittent fasting in detail, explain why it has become so popular, and what the health benefits are.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Concept of Intermittent Fasting</strong><br>Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern where you cycle between periods of eating and fasting. It does not specify which foods you should eat, but rather when you should eat them. Since it isn’t a diet that restricts what you can eat, intermittent fasting can be easier to stick with than other trends. At Total Health and Fitness, our nutrition plans are designed to cater to your tastes and teach you how to eat sustainably, not restrict you. Intermittent fasting</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are several different intermittent fasting schedules, but the most common one is 16:8. This means that you fast for 16 hours and eat only during an 8-hour window. For example, you could stop eating at 8 pm and not eat again until noon the next day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other popular intermittent fasting schedules include 18:6 (fast for 18 hours, eat for 6) and 20:4 (fast for 20 hours, eat for 4).</p><p>Some people also do a more extreme version of intermittent fasting called the warrior diet, which involves fasting for 20 hours and eating one large meal at night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What Can Be Consumed During the Fast</strong><br>It’s not advised that you go without hydrating during the fasting period. Keep drinking water or other zero-calorie beverages, including coffee, tea, or sparkling water.</p><p>It’s important to be mindful of the fasting length; going too long between meals can simulate to the body that there’s a lack of food. As a result, the body will go into something similar to starvation mode, and it will hold on to fat reserves instead of allowing the body to use them for fuel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why Intermittent Fasting is So Popular</strong><br>There are a few different reasons why intermittent fasting has become so popular in recent years. Since it doesn’t dictate what you can and can’t eat, it can be less intimidating than fad diets. Also, much of the time spent fasting is overnight, which makes it less of a struggle to go the 16 hours outlined in a traditional schedule.</p><p>You also don’t have to reduce the number of calories you consume each meal, but it can be part of your intermittent fasting plan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Benefits of Intermittent Fasting</strong><br>The results of intermittent fasting will vary from person to person and will be affected by activity level and other health factors. Overall, however, intermittent fasting has shown to be an effective weight loss tool.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why It Works</strong></p><p>According to Dr. Mark Mattson, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins, intermittent fasting works because it “contrasts with the normal eating pattern for most Americans.” Instead of constantly fueling the body with “new” calories, fasting signals to the body’s hormones that fat reserves should be used as fuel. Here are some other positive changes fasting can promote in the body:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lower insulin levels<br>Increased human growth hormone (HGH) levels<br>Cellular repair response<br>Increased metabolism<br>Increased norepinephrine (noradrenaline)<br>Reduced oxidative stress<br>Reduced inflammation<br>Improved blood sugar levels<br>Improved blood pressure<br>Lower LDL cholesterol levels<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Intermittent fasting is also thought to be beneficial for other aspects of one’s health as well. It has been linked to lower rates of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Additionally, intermittent fasting has been shown to improve brain function and protect against age-related cognitive decline.</p><p>It could take up to a month to start feeling and seeing the results of intermittent fasting, so remember that it’s a lifestyle change and not a quick fix.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who Should NOT Try Intermittent Fasting</strong><br>Always check with y our medical provider before deciding on an eating plan, whether it’s intermittent fasting or something else. While timed eating can be beneficial to many, it’s not for everyone. If you fall into one or more of the following categories, you may not want to try intermittent fasting:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Currently pregnant<br>Currently breastfeeding<br>Diabetic<br>Under 18 years of age<br>Anyone in recovery from eating disorders<br>If you are looking to start intermittent fasting, there are several different schedules you can follow to suit your lifestyle. Find the one that works best for you and stick with it. Your body will thank you!</p>', 0x33313634376364356562323238383064653337383535633439363833373037312e6a706567, 'Health & Fitness', 'Swarup', '51b66d259a2732797220051f0bd65c13', '2023-06-22 10:43:57.430884'),

While scamsters are increasingly misusing it to carry out frauds in the cyber space, technological advancements can also be employed as a counter to prevent financial irregularities and ensure transparency to rule out the possibility of any such malpractice in the first place. Let’s take a deep dive into how blockchain technology can be employed as a solution to curb fraudulent activities in the real estate sector and promote transparency and accountability in public dealings.</p><p>Crux of the problem: Transparency, accountability sorely lacking</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even as the government is working out ways to curtail corruption, advanced technological interventions are emerging as an effective alternative to check the huge losses to the state exchequer. A case in point that calls for the need for greater transparency and accountability is the recent Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) scam reported in the media, where PSIEC officials allegedly received kickbacks for facilitating illegal land deals for a residential township in collusion with private developers, who are said to have made huge profits by selling the land to people at much higher prices. Likewise, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India had unearthed a land scam in Faridabad district of Haryana, where illegal construction of a multi-storeyed building was allowed on notified prime forest land for selling office spaces. It’s the lack of transparency in land deals and the absence of a foolproof mechanism to conduct transactions and maintain records that is accentuating the problem.</p><p>However, technological interventions can well make these malpractices a thing of the past. Such scams and fraudulent activities in the real estate sector can easily be prevented with the help of blockchain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blockchain technology provides the answer</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blockchain technology can help establish a transparent and tamper-proof system for land and property transactions, making it difficult for corrupt officials and middlemen to manipulate records and transactions. By using blockchain-based land registries, the government can ensure the immutability and safety of land records and document transactions in a transparent manner, leaving no room for fraudulent activities.</p><p>Andhra Pradesh, a fitting case study</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andhra Pradesh has already shown the way by becoming the first state in the country to use blockchain technology to put an end to tampering of land records and issue land record certificates to people in its new capital, Amravati. The results have been quite encouraging, and other state governments should follow suit.</p><p>Using blockchain for land records</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blockchain can prevent the bifurcation and sale of industrial plots to benefit real estate companies by providing an immutable record of land transactions. Blockchain-based land registries can enable the authorities to make land records tamper-proof and transparent, thus ruling out the possibility of manipulation and fraud. As of now, most of the data is either in physical form or in the form of E-files, which are stored in a central database that is prone to tampering.</p><p>Blockchain can fix accountability and bring efficiency in government organizations as it records all transactions on a public ledger that can be accessed by authorized parties. You can also implement smart contracts on blockchain to automate the process of land sale, lease and transfer, thus eliminating the need for intermediaries and thereby reducing the scope for fraud.</p>', 0x61653134326661336664623338633732353636623936303436666464346539352e706e67, 'Technology', 'Swarup', '44a95776e7870b73facc52b00e82d78e', '2023-06-22 10:46:42.629246'),

(22, 'Spider Man Across the Spider Verse', '<p>My esteemed colleague Christy Lemire opened her review of <strong>“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse”</strong> with a quote from her nine-year-old asking if he could see it again, so I think there’s some synergy in quoting my nine-year-old to open this one: “That might be the best movie I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”</strong> explodes onto screens this week, building on the foundation of the masterful “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” with stunning animation, unforgettable characters, and complex themes. The first note I took after seeing it was “so much movie.” Like the work of a young artist who refuses to be restrained by the borders of the frame, “Across the Spider-Verse” is loaded with incredible imagery and fascinating ideas. It is a smart, thrilling piece of work that reminded me of other great part twos like “The Dark Knight” and “The Empire Strikes Back.” Like those films, it leaves viewers anxiously anticipating the next chapter (which will come in March 2024), and it earns its cliffhangers by grounding them in a story of young people refusing to submit to a concept of what a hero’s arc needs to be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Across the Spider-Verse”</strong> opens just over a year after the action of the first movie. Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) is back in her universe, trying to keep her identity secret from her father, George (Shea Whigham). When an alternate version of the villainous Vulture (Jorma Taccone) drops into her reality, the bad guy ends up trailed by the intense Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac) and confident Spider-Woman (Issa Rae). They reveal to Gwen that they’re part of a secret Spider-Society that has been cleaning up inter-universe messes, capturing villains who end up in the wrong one and sending them home again. When Gwen’s identity is blown with her dad, she joins the Spider-Crew, correcting the errors of multi-verse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, fans will remember that Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) is essentially one of those errors. The Peter Parker of his universe died trying to save him, and the spider that bit Miles was never supposed to be there. But it was. So now what? This story\\\'s backbone is about pushing back against determinism and moving forward with what\\\'s in front of you. Superhero culture has used multiverse stories to expand on the concept of potential, but this film (and I hope these themes really land in its sequel) suggests that it’s way more important to hold onto the reality in your hands than imagine all of the other ones that might have been. It’s about controlling your own fate more than giving into a scripted narrative of heroism. More than most superhero movies, it’s about empowerment instead of destiny.
